# Hangout Rank

## Description

When planning a hangout, sometimes it's hard to decide on where to go or what to eat.

This app allows a signed in user to create an hangout. A hangout will then be created with a unique link that can be shared with friends. 

Friends can then vote on where to go or what to eat. The app will then tally the votes and display the winner.

The app uses ranked-based voting so it will base the winner on the most preferred option.
